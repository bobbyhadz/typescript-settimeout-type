## Python: Remove the first two (or N) characters from String

**Use string slicing to remove the first two characters from a string, e.g.
`result = my_str[2:]`. The new string will contain a slice of the original
string with the first two characters removed.**

```python:main.py
my_str = 'avocado'

result_1 = my_str[2:]
print(result_1)  # 👉️ 'ocado'

result_2 = my_str.lstrip(my_str[0:2])
print(result_2)  # 👉️ 'ocado'

result_3 = my_str.lstrip('av')
print(result_3)  # 👉️ 'ocado'

# ✅ remove the first two words from a string
my_str_2 = 'one two three four five six'

result_4 = my_str_2.split(' ', 2)[2]
print(result_4)  # 👉️ 'three four five six'
```

The first example uses string slicing to remove the first two characters from a
string.

The syntax for string slicing is `my_str[start:stop:step]`.

<Alert>
  The <code>start</code> index is inclusive, whereas the <code>stop</code> index
  is exclusive (up to, but not including).
</Alert>

Python indexes are zero-based, so the first character in a string has an index
of `0`, and the last character has an index of `-1` or `len(my_str) - 1`.

The slice `my_str[2:]` starts at the character at index `2` and goes to the end
of the string.

```python:main.py
print('hello'[2:])  # 👉️ 'llo'

print('world'[2:])  # 👉️ 'rld'

print('test'[2:])  # 👉️ 'st'
```

If you use this approach with an empty string, you will get an empty string
back.

```python:main.py
print(''[2:]) # 👉️ ''
```

No error is raised even though the string in the example is empty.

Alternatively, you can use the `str.lstrip()` method.

```python:main.py
my_str = 'avocado'

result_1 = my_str.lstrip(my_str[0:2])
print(result_1)  # 👉️ 'ocado'

result_2 = my_str.lstrip('av')
print(result_2)  # 👉️ 'ocado'
```

The first example uses a slice of `0:2` to get the first 2 characters of the
string.

The [str.lstrip](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.lstrip)
method takes a string containing characters as an argument and returns a copy of
the string with the specified leading characters removed.

The method does not change the original string, it returns a new string. Strings
are immutable in Python.

<Alert>
  Note that the <code>str.lstrip()</code> method doesn't necessarily remove only
  the first two characters from the string.
</Alert>

The method removes all occurrences and combinations of the specified characters
from the start of the string.

Use the `str.split()` method if you need to remove the first two words from a
string.

```python:main.py
my_str = 'one two three four five six'

result = my_str.split(' ', 2)[2]
print(result)  # 👉️ 'three four five six'
```

We split the string on a space 2 times and returned the third list item.

You can also use the `str.removeprefix()` method to remove the first two
characters from a string.

```python:main.py
my_str = 'avocado'

result = my_str.removeprefix(my_str[0:2])

print(result)  # 👉️ 'ocado'
```

The
[str.removeprefix](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.removeprefix)
method checks if the string starts with the specified prefix and if it does, the
method returns a new string excluding the prefix, otherwise it returns a copy of
the original string.

The `removeprefix` method can also be used to remove more than `2` characters
from the start of the string.

You can use the same approach to remove the first N characters from a string.

## Remove the first N characters from a String in Python

**Use string slicing to remove the first N characters from a string, e.g.
`new_string = string[N:]`. The slice will remove the first N characters from the
string by returning a copy of the string that starts at the character after the
first N characters.**

```python:main.py
string = 'bobbyhadz.com'

# ✅ Remove the first 2 characters from a string
new_string = string[2:]
print(new_string)  # 👉️ bbyhadz.com

# ✅ Remove the first 3 characters from a string
new_string = string[3:]
print(new_string)  # 👉️ byhadz.com

# ✅ Remove the first 4 characters from a string
new_string = string[4:]
print(new_string)  # 👉️ yhadz.com
```

We used string slicing to remove the first N characters from a string.

The syntax for string slicing is `my_str[start:stop:step]`.

<Alert>
  The <code>start</code> index is inclusive, whereas the <code>stop</code> index
  is exclusive (up to, but not including).
</Alert>

Python indexes are zero-based, so the first character in a string has an index
of `0`, and the last character has an index of `-1` or `len(my_str) - 1`.

The slice `string[2:]` starts at index `2` and goes to the end of the string.

```python:main.py
string = 'bobbyhadz.com'

new_string = string[2:]
print(new_string)  # 👉️ bbyhadz.com
```

In other words, the slice removes the first 2 characters of the string (indices
`0` and `1`).

If you don't need to keep the original variable around, reassign it rather than
declaring a new variable.

```python:main.py
string = 'bobbyhadz.com'

string = string[3:]
print(string)  # 👉️ byhadz.com
```

The slice `string[3:]` starts at index `3` and goes to the end of the string.

In other words, it removes the first 3 characters from the string (indices `0`,
`1` and `2`).


The
[str.startswith](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.startswith)
method returns `True` if the string starts with the provided prefix, otherwise
the method returns `False`.

You can also use string slicing if you need to get the two parts of the string.

```python:main.py
string = 'bobbyhadz.com'

n = 3

before, after = string[:n], string[n:]

print(before)  # 👉️ bob
print(after)  # 👉️ byhadz.com
```

The slice `string[:3]` starts at index `0` and goes up to, but not including
index `3`.

In other words, it returns the first 3 characters in the string (indices `0`,
`1` and `2`).

The slice `string[3:]` starts at index `3` and goes to the end of the string.

Alternatively, you can use the `str.replace()` method.

## Remove the first N characters from a String using str.replace()

**To remove the first N characters from a string:**

1. Use string slicing to get the first N characters of the string.
2. Use the `str.replace()` method to remove the first N characters from the
   string.
3. Remove the characters by replacing them with an empty string.

```python:main.py
string = 'bobbyhadz.com'

n = 2

new_string = string.replace(string[:n], '', 1)
print(new_string)  # 👉️ bbyhadz.com
```

We used the `str.replace()` method to remove the first N characters from a
string by replacing them with an empty string.

<Alert>
  By default, the <code>str.replace()</code> method replaces all occurrences of
  the provided substring in the string, so we specified a count of{' '}
  <code>1</code> to make sure we only replace the first occurrence.
</Alert>

The [str.replace](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.replace)
method returns a copy of the string with all occurrences of a substring replaced
by the provided replacement.

The method takes the following parameters:

| Name  | Description                                                |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| old   | The substring we want to replace in the string             |
| new   | The replacement for each occurrence of `old`               |
| count | Only the first `count` occurrences are replaced (optional) |

The method doesn't change the original string. Strings are immutable in Python.

Alternatively, you can use a `for` loop.

## Remove the first N characters from a String using a for loop

**To remove the first N characters from a string:**

1. Use a `for` loop to iterate over the string with `enumerate()`.
2. Check if the index is greater than or equal to N.
3. If the condition is met, append the current character to a new string.

```python:main.py
string = 'bobbyhadz.com'

new_string = ''

n = 3

for index, char in enumerate(string):
    if index >= n:
        new_string += char

print(new_string)  # 👉️ 'byhadz.com'
```

We used the `enumerate()` function to get access to the index of the current
iteration.

```python:main.py
string = 'abc'

for index, char in enumerate(string):
    print(char, index)  # 👉️ a 0, b 1, c 2
```

The [enumerate](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate)
function takes an iterable and returns an enumerate object containing tuples
where the first element is the index and the second is the corresponding item.

On each iteration, we check if the current index is greater than or equal to N.

If the condition is met, we add the current character to a new string.

The `+=` operator is a shorthand for `new_string = new_string + char`.

Note that this approach is much slower than the previous two.

Which approach you pick is a matter of personal preference. I'd use string
slicing as I find it quite direct and intuitive.
